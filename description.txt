Sols Fringe Reborn is a mod that adds in 2 weapons, which serve as crimson alternatives for the Night's Edge, and the True Night's Edge respectively. These weapons are called "Sols Fringe" & "True Sols Fringe".

Both weapons do slightly more damage than their counterparts, in exchange for being a fair bit slower. 

This mod took heavy inspiration from its predecessor, Sols Fringe. It was a mod I had a part in making and I hope to revive it, because as a concept, the nights edge not having a crimson alternative has been bugging me for awhile.

Feedback is GREATLY appreciated, I would love to balance these out and iron out any bugs there may be.
